# MobileNet V2:
 MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for efficient and lightweight deep learning tasks. It's particularly useful for mobile and embedded applications due to its compact design while maintaining respectable accuracy. The architecture contains multiple layers, including depthwise separable convolutions, that allow it to achieve a good trade-off between model size and performance.
